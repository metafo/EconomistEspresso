Three men, two British and one Moroccan, captured by pro-Russian forces in a disputed part of Ukraine were handed a death sentence. The Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-proclaimed republic in a disputed part of eastern Ukraine, has accused the men of being mercenaries. The two Britons were serving in the Ukrainian army when they were captured. The British government says the men should be treated as prisoners of war.

Vladimir Putin said it was his “destiny” to “return and fortify” territories, just as it had been Peter the Great’s. The Russian president said that in the tsar’s conquest of the Baltic coast in the 18th century “he wasn’t taking anything away—he was returning it”. When Peter the Great founded St Petersburg “none of the countries of Europe recognised it as Russian”, he said.

The congressional hearings on the January 6th assault on America’s Capitol begin on Thursday. A House committee of seven Democrats and two Republicans will try to prove that the supporters of Donald Trump who stormed the building last year were part of a coordinated attack on democracy. Separately, the FBI arrested Ryan Kelley, a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Michigan, on misdemeanour charges connected to the riot.

Iran began removing the monitoring equipment it was required to install under the 2015 nuclear deal, undermining attempts to revive the agreement. The move came in retaliation for a resolution on Wednesday from the International Atomic Energy Agency criticising Iran for failing to explain uranium traces found at three undeclared sites. The IAEA demanded that Iran engage with the watchdog “without delay”. Only China and Russia opposed the resolution.

Parts of Shanghai were locked down yet again, as China’s biggest city continues its pyrrhic battle with covid-19. Minhang district, home to 2m people, will be the latest to be quarantined. Meanwhile, many temporary testing stations—which must be within a 15-minute walk for Shanghainese—are being made permanent. Last week China’s government declared victory against the virus in Shanghai following a costly two-month lockdown.

Paris’s police chief, Didier Lallement, admitted that the policing of the Champions League final on May 28th between Real Madrid and Liverpool had been a “failure”. The game was delayed for 30 minutes as officers in riot gear prevented Liverpool supporters from entering the ground and tear-gassed the fans, including women and children. Initially, the French authorities blamed Liverpool fans for the chaos.

New Zealand announced a plan to tax sheep and cow burps to address one of its biggest sources of greenhouse gases. The country had been criticised for not including agriculture in its emissions-trading scheme, when almost half of its emissions, mainly methane, come from the sector. New Zealand is home to 5m people, but 26m or so sheep and 10m cattle.

A high plateau for inflation in America

There has been much talk of America nearing “peak inflation”. The hope was that price pressures, though still high, were about to start dissipating. But data for May, due to be published on Friday, will show that the peak looks more like a plateau—and an elevated one at that.

Economists forecast that consumer prices last month were 8.3% higher than a year earlier, roughly the same annual increase as in March and April. Some of the blame belongs to the continued rise in oil prices, clearly evident at the petrol pump. Worryingly, though, core inflation (which strips out food and energy) is also expected to have remained high. That reflects rising prices for services, which stem in part from higher wages in an ultra-tight labour market. Given this backdrop, the Federal Reserve will forge ahead with further hefty interest-rate increases. Consumers, companies and investors weary of high inflation will be stuck with it for a while.

A cautious reopening for Japanese tourism

Japan closed its borders soon after the pandemic began in 2020. Even the Tokyo Olympics last year were held without foreign spectators. On Friday the country welcomes its first foreign tourists back. Yet the doors are only partially open.

Entry comes with strict conditions. Those on officially approved guided tours can enter the country; individual travellers remain barred. Eligibility is limited to visitors from 98 “low-risk” countries. Chaperones will watch over tourists throughout their visit, keeping records of their movements and ensuring they abide by pandemic precautions, including mask-wearing. Rule-breakers risk being sent home.

Japan will also cap overseas arrivals at 20,000 people per day. That is a far cry from the pre-pandemic crowds: in 2019 nearly 32m foreign tourists came to Japan, an average of more than 87,000 per day. But border controls remain popular among the Japanese. A full reopening is unlikely at least until after elections to Japan’s upper house in early July.


Missing in the Amazon

The search continues for Dom Phillips, a British journalist, and Bruno Araújo Pereira, his Brazilian guide and an expert in indigenous affairs. The pair went missing in the Javari valley, an indigenous territory in the Brazilian Amazon, on Sunday. The region is known for “uncontacted” tribes who shun contact with the outside world. As in many parts of the Amazon, illegal loggers, miners and fishermen, as well as drug traffickers, have increased their activities in the valley in recent years. These incursions have sparked tensions with indigenous groups—some of which have tipped into violence. Mr Pereira reportedly received death threats before his trip although it is unclear from whom.

Brazil’s authorities have been slow to respond. President Jair Bolsonaro, who has long been disdainful of the media, dismissed the men’s reporting trip as an “adventure”. He drew criticism for not deploying the army quickly enough. The world was already watching the Amazon, as deforestation accelerated on Mr Bolsonaro’s watch. Now they have more reasons to worry.

A bumpy takeoff for the airline industry

The pandemic denied passengers both the joy and pain of travel, as borders were closed and airlines grounded their fleets. Now, as countries reopen, the urge among travellers to make up for lost time is causing misery in Europe and America. Passengers heading to airports on Friday are nervous after weeks of packed airports, and delayed or cancelled flights, which have left hordes of dissatisfied customers. Some have even been stranded abroad. But this is a sign that aviation is getting back to normal. But this is a sign that aviation is getting back to normal.

The number of seats on offer worldwide is close to pre-pandemic levels. But the pace of recovery caught the industry by surprise. Airports in particular are struggling to cope with a sharp increase in passengers and to replace workers laid off during the pandemic. Staff shortages caused by dismissals of ground and air crew during the pandemic have already caused some airlines to forgo adding even more capacity to meet the surging demand. Add the sky-high oil price, and a hot summer could be followed by a difficult winter.

BTS’s new album prepares for lift-off

Nine years after releasing their first single BTS, a South Korean boy band, have become one of the world’s most successful groups. One of the few K-pop outfits to break America, BTS have racked up a string of number ones and a Grammy nomination. The group has political influence, too: the seven boys have visited the White House and spoken at the UN. In August their single “Dynamite”, which has 1.5bn views on YouTube, will travel to space courtesy of South Korea’s first lunar orbiter.

The release of BTS’s new album, “Proof”, on Friday, has attracted corresponding hype. Yet this three-disk release is a little different. It features greatest hits from throughout the band’s career, along with previously unheard demos and three new tracks. Cynics will draw comparisons to the interminable box sets put out by ageing rock stars keen on bolstering their pensions. But the world-beaters of BTS—none of whose members is yet 30—can safely ignore the naysayers.
