Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union’s last leader, died at hospital in Moscow, aged 91. As president he launched a set of policies known as glasnost and perestroika, aimed at opening the Soviet economy and democratising its politics. Mr Gorbachev also cultivated warmer relations with the West and supported communist reformers in central and eastern Europe. He won the Nobel peace prize in 1990, and reluctantly watched the Soviet Union collapse in 1991.

Ukraine claimed to have destroyed bridges across the Dnipro river and ammunition depots in its counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied region of Kherson. Meanwhile, UN inspectors arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, intending to visit the Zaporizhia nuclear plant, though Ukrainian officials accused Russia of trying to sabotage the mission. At a meeting in Prague, European Union defence ministers considered a proposal to train Ukrainian troops, which America, Britain and several EU countries are already doing.

The UN appealed for $160m in aid to help victims of Pakistan’s floods, which have now submerged a third of the country. António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, blamed the disaster squarely on climate change, and “sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet”. More than 1,100 Pakistanis are known to have been killed and half a million are now living in camps. The country’s planning minister warned of imminent food shortages.

The Chinese Communist Party’s leadership congress will start on October 16th, according to state media. Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third five-year term as party leader at the gathering, despite the country’s economic woes—figures released on Tuesday showed the manufacturing sector shrank for a second consecutive month in August. The congress will also be watched for signs that China’s draconian zero-covid strategy has nearly run its course.

Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy giant, said it would suspend its supply of natural gas to Engie, a European firm based in Paris, starting Thursday. Gazprom blamed a billing dispute, though a French minister said that Russia is simply “using gas as a weapon of war”. Gazprom was already set to close the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on Wednesday, ostensibly for a few days’ repair.

Elon Musk argued in a court filing that allegations of lax security at Twitter, made recently by its former security chief, bolstered the case for voiding his bid for the social-media firm. He also sought to delay the trial that will determine whether or not he must honour the $44bn acquisition agreement, until November.

Mississippi’s governor declared an emergency in the state capital of Jackson, after floods damaged the water-treatment system and left 180,000 people without potable water. Residents were told to drink only bottled water “for an unknown period of time”. Jackson’s water crisis is not new: in 2020 America’s Environmental Protection Agency warned of lead pipes and other problems there.

Fact of the day: 64%, the percentage of American pharmacists struggling to get enough Adderall, a stimulant drug, according to a new survey. Read the full story.

Europe accelerates its energy reform

“Preventive maintenance” of its pipelines is how Russia reminds Europeans of its energy chokehold on the continent. On Wednesday it will close down for three days Nord Stream 1, a pipeline that delivers natural gas from Russia to Germany and beyond. That will rattle Europeans, who are trying to refuel ahead of winter. Gas prices soared on the news last week.

The flow through Nord Stream 1 has already thinned, following ten days of maintenance in July. Russia says sanctions have made it difficult to source parts to keep it running properly; Germany denies that. Either way, expensive gas is pushing up energy tariffs across Europe, squeezing the finances of households and governments. That has prompted the EU to mull an emergency measure to decouple gas and electricity prices, though details remain scarce. A structural reform of the energy market is also brewing, as European leaders seek to move past Russia’s pipeline politics.


The UN faces its own deadline

The departing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has promised to end her tenure on Wednesday with the release of a long-awaited report on Xinjiang. The western Chinese region, where the state appears to run a gulag for Uyghurs, a Muslim minority of 12m, is home to some of the world’s most glaring attacks on human rights. Yet the UN report has been three years in the works and its publication delayed for months. That is testimony to China’s leverage over the organisation. China issued a letter, signed by some 40 other countries, requesting the UN to bury the report. Last week Ms Bachelet revealed her office was under “tremendous pressure” over its publication.

The commissioner faces two tests. The first is whether she will meet her own publication deadline. The second is how harshly she will be willing to criticise China. Her heavily controlled visit to Xinjiang in May dampened hope of that.

Feeling the heat of the COP27 summit

On Wednesday climate and environment ministers from the G20 countries—the world’s leading economies—will meet in Bali, Indonesia. They will be focused on COP27, a UN climate summit to be held in Egypt in November. At the previous summit in Glasgow last year world leaders acknowledged that their pledges to reduce carbon emissions were not nearly strong enough to meet the previously agreed goal of keeping global temperatures “well below” 2°C above pre-industrial levels. They vowed to do better.

But so far only two G20 countries have made good on that promise. Australia now plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 43% by 2030 (against 2005 levels), up from the previous figure of 26-28%. India, meanwhile, promises a cut of 45% over the same period, up from 33-35%, provided that it receives “international resources” to reach the goal. With less than ten weeks until COP27, expect a squabble in Bali over who should offer what, and—as ever—who should pay.

Tragedy foretold in Ethiopia’s war

Both Ethiopia’s government and the rebels accuse the other of shooting first. A fragile truce which held up for five months in the country’s north has crumbled. Fierce fighting around the border between the Tigray and Amhara regions is spreading. Hopes for a peace deal between the federal government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) have been dashed.

Tigray has been under siege for more than a year. TPLF leaders warned they would restart the fight if Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, failed to release the hold. Abiy’s government refused talks appended by such “preconditions”. Two days after the ceasefire collapsed on August 24th, its forces struck Tigray’s capital, Mekele, killing at least four people including two children. The Tigrayans have since gathered momentum, advancing towards the Amhara town of Weldiya and threatening to seize it. That might just be a precursor to a strike westwards, to reclaim territory annexed by Amhara at the start of the war.

Venice makes up for lost time

After two quiet years overshadowed by the pandemic, the world’s oldest film festival returns on Wednesday with an abundance of high-profile films from Oscar-winning directors. The 79th gala in Venice opens with “White Noise”, an adaptation of Don DeLillo’s novel, written and directed by Noah Baumbach, responsible for “Marriage Story” in 2019.

The following days will feature screenings of Andrew Dominik’s “Blonde”, based on Joyce Carol Oates’s fictionalised biography of Marilyn Monroe; “Bardo”, a Mexican semi-autobiographical comedy-drama from Alejandro Iñárritu (“The Revenant”); and “Bones and All”, a cannibal road movie starring Timothée Chalamet and directed by Luca Guadagnino (“Call Me By Your Name”). That line-up of the festival’s favourite male directors will be supplemented by Olivia Wilde. She is making her Venice debut with a 1950s-set mystery, “Don’t Worry Darling”, featuring her pop-singer boyfriend, Harry Styles. Cinema-starved fans and paparazzi alike will be in for a feast.
