Vladimir Putin said if the West supplied Ukraine with longer-range missiles Russia would strike targets it has so far avoided. Last week Joe Biden said America would supply Ukraine with M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems after receiving assurances they would not be fired into Russia. Britain also pledged such weapons. Mr Putin said the shipments were “nothing new”; longer-range munitions for them would prompt a response.

Russian forces hit Kyiv with cruise missiles, according to Ukrainian officials, the first attack on the capital in weeks. Five rockets were fired from the Caspian Sea, one was shot down and one hit a rail depot, they said. Meanwhile the governor of Luhansk said Severodonetsk was now divided “more or less” in half between Ukrainian and Russian troops. It had been reported that 70% of the strategically important eastern city had been captured by Russia, until a Ukrainian counterattack. Reports from Russia suggested another of its generals had been killed in the region.

Reports swirled that a no-confidence motion against Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, is now imminent. Fifty-four Conservative MPs must submit secret letters of no-confidence in their leader to trigger a vote. Whether Mr Johnson—buffeted by revelations that he partied during covid lockdowns and lagging in the polls—would prevail is uncertain. As his predecessor as prime minister, Theresa May, found, even winning such a vote may not offer job protection for long.

America and South Korea said they fired eight surface-to-surface missiles on Monday, a day after North Korea carried out probably its biggest single missile test. According to South Korea’s army, the joint exercise was meant to demonstrate “the capability and readiness to carry out precision strikes”. Japan and America also conducted a joint exercise on Sunday in response to North Korea’s actions.

Google was ordered to pay A$715,000 ($515,000) to an Australian politician over videos posted by a comedian on its YouTube service. Jordan Shanks’s diatribes described John Barilaro, a former deputy premier of the state of New South Wales, as “corrupt” and used racist language against him. The judge said Google had failed to prevent cyberbullying and hate speech.

Ant Group, a Chinese fintech giant part-owned by Alibaba, launched a digital wholesale bank called ANEXT in Singapore. The bank will focus on providing digital financial services to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Singapore’s banking regulator has said it expects Sea and Grab, two other big Asian consumer-tech firms, to launch digital banks later this year.

The World Health Organisation said that there have been 780 confirmed monkeypox cases over the past three weeks in countries where it is not endemic. It is the first time that the usually mild infection has spread beyond west and central Africa, mainly to Europe and America. The WHO thinks the global risk level from monkeypox is “moderate”.

European divisions on Ukraine

The gap among Western countries over the endgame in Ukraine keeps widening. Germany is often chastised for being a Russlandversteher, a “Russia understander”. But that title might best apply to France after its president, Emmanuel Macron, repeated a comment he made last month that “Russia must not be humiliated”. Ukrainian leaders are furious.

What is Mr Macron up to? He appears to be motivated by memories of the 1919 Versailles treaty whose punitive terms, many argue, led to the rise of Nazism and the second world war. If so, such thinking seems premature. War in Ukraine is still raging. The battle for the eastern city of Severodonetsk hangs in the balance.

Mr Macron may be worried about nuclear escalation, particularly if the Russian army is routed. He may also hope to cast himself as a mediator in any future peace talks, which requires maintaining distance from America and a dialogue with Russia.


All at odds in the Americas

Expectations are low for what could be a particularly fractious Summit of the Americas, a regional gathering starting in Los Angeles on Monday. For starters, the presidents of several countries, including Mexico, Honduras and Bolivia, say they won’t come, in protest over the United States’ decision not to invite authoritarian heads of state in Nicaragua and Venezuela (and maybe Cuba). Guatemala’s president is also skipping the get-together over US sanctions on his government.

Progress is unlikely whatever the guest list. Long gone are the days of bold declarations, such as a charter in 2001 that committed the region’s countries to democracy. The United States has been losing clout in the Americas, while several countries are retreating from democracy and free trade. That is bad news for everyone. As well as perennial issues such as migration, the region needs to respond to problems both exposed and deepened by the pandemic, including wobbly health and education systems, and poverty.

A tight race in Pennsylvania

After a bruising campaign and recount, Mehmet Oz emerged victorious in Pennsylvania’s Republican Senate primary on Friday. After polls closed on May 17th, just 902 votes put Dr Oz, a television star endorsed by Donald Trump, ahead of his opponent, David McCormick, triggering the recount. Mr Trump urged Dr Oz to declare victory prematurely, while Mr McCormick won a court case to include undated ballots. But with his numbers unimproved, Mr McCormick conceded defeat.

Dr Oz must now convince more Republicans of his conservative bona fides while still tacking to the centre. Though he benefits from Americans’ souring opinions of Democrats, Pennsylvania is closely divided. It provides Democrats with one of their few chances to flip a Republican-held seat and preserve their narrow Senate majority. With his working-class demeanour and moderate positioning, the Democratic nominee, state lieutenant-governor John Fetterman, looks formidable. But after suffering a stroke on May 13th, he has yet to return to campaigning.

Decisions ahead for the Supreme Court

On Monday America’s justices release rulings in one or more of the 33 cases that remain to be decided before their summer holiday. An unusual number of high-profile disputes dot the docket. The court will determine the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions in power plants. Cases involving school funding inMaine and a praying football coach in the state of Washington could weaken America’s wall of separation between church and state. A challenge to a gun regulation in New York gives the court a chance to bolster the right to bear arms.

Meanwhile it seems the right to abortion—according to a draft opinion leaked on May 2nd—will be erased 49 years after it gained constitutional protection in Roe v Wade. Tensions are high at the court amid an investigation into the leak and, with its 6-3 conservative tilt, the court faces plummeting support among a public that is roughly split 50-50. The drama is unlikely to ebb before the July 4th holiday.

The lady’s not for burning

Margaret Atwood, a Canadian writer, was recently filmed trying to torch a copy of her 1985 novel “The Handmaid’s Tale”. Brandishing a flame-thrower, she took aim, but this “unburnable” edition, printed on foil paper with nickel wire and stainless-steel binding, survived. It is to be auctioned on Tuesday at Sotheby’s, to draw attention to a wave of book bannings in America. “The Handmaid’s Tale”, which depicts a nightmare theocracy, is among the world’s most widely forbidden works.

The auction benefits PEN America, a charity supporting free expression, to combat conservative attacks on books about gender issues, racism and sex education. The American Library Association reports that complainants tried to remove 1,597 titles in 2021, a fourfold increase from the year before. “Let’s hope we don’t reach the stage of wholesale book burnings, as in Fahrenheit 451,” Ms Atwood says, referring to Ray Bradbury’s dystopian novel. Bidding for her own unburnable book currently stands at $100,000.
